# Approach 1
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  SET N = N - 1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee 
      ORDER BY Salary DESC
      LIMIT N, 1 # ignore the first (n-1)th rows, select the nth row from top
  );
END


# Approach 2
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary) FROM Employee) >= N THEN MIN(n_highest_salary.Salary) 
      ELSE null
      END 
      FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT N) n_highest_salary
  );
